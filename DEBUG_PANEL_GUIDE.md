# 🐛 On-Screen Debug Panel - Telegram Mini App

## ✅ What I've Added

Since F12 developer tools don't work in Telegram Mini App, I've added an **on-screen debug panel** that captures all console logs and displays them directly in your app!

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. **Look for the Bug Button** 🐛
- You'll see a yellow circular button with 🐛 in the bottom-right corner of the app
- It's positioned above the navigation bar

### 2. **Open the Debug Panel**
- Tap the 🐛 button
- A black panel with yellow border will appear showing all console logs in real-time

### 3. **Test YouTube Quest**
- Open a YouTube quest
- Click "Watch Video"
- Wait for the timer to complete
- Watch the debug panel fill with logs showing each step

### 4. **Quick Test Button**
- In the debug panel header, there's a green "Test" button
- Tap it to run an instant test of the code input element
- It will show:
  - ✅ If element exists
  - Current display state
  - Attempt to force show it with RED BORDER
  - Whether it succeeded

## 📊 What You'll See

The debug panel shows all logs with colors:
- 🟢 **Green** = Normal log messages
- 🔴 **Red** = Errors (❌)
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Warnings (⚠️)
- 🔵 **Blue** = Info messages

### Expected Logs During YouTube Quest:

```
📄 SHOW QUEST DETAIL PAGE
   Task type: youtube
📦 GENERATE QUEST CONTENT
   🎬 Generating YouTube quest content
   ✅ YouTube content rendered
🎥 START YOUTUBE QUEST
✅ Opened video in new tab
🚀 Starting timer...
🎬 START TIMER - Required time: 30
⏱️ Timer: 5/30 seconds
⏱️ Timer: 10/30 seconds
...
✅ TIMER COMPLETE! Calling unlockCodeInput...
🔓 UNLOCK CODE INPUT CALLED
   Element exists: true
   ✅ Code input section should now be visible!
```

## 🧪 Quick Tests

### Test 1: Check Element Exists
1. Open any YouTube quest
2. Open debug panel (tap 🐛)
3. Tap "Test" button in panel header
4. Look for: "Element: FOUND ✅"

### Test 2: Force Show Code Input
1. Open a YouTube quest
2. Let timer run (or wait)
3. Open debug panel
4. Tap "Test" button
5. It will try to show the code input with a **RED BORDER**
6. Scroll down and look for a red-bordered box

### Test 3: Full Flow
1. Open debug panel FIRST (tap 🐛)
2. Then start a YouTube quest
3. Click "Watch Video"
4. Watch the logs appear in real-time
5. When timer completes, check if:
   - Logs show "UNLOCK CODE INPUT CALLED"
   - Element is found
   - Code input becomes visible

## 🔧 Debug Panel Controls

**🐛 Button** (bottom-right)
- Tap to show/hide debug panel

**Test Button** (green, in panel)
- Run instant code input test
- Shows element status
- Tries to force show with red border

**Clear Button** (in panel)
- Clear all logs
- Start fresh

**× Button** (in panel)
- Close debug panel

## 📸 What to Report Back

If code input still doesn't appear, please tell me:

1. **Does the Test button show:**
   - "Element: FOUND ✅" or "NOT FOUND ❌"?

2. **If FOUND, does the red border appear?**
   - Yes = Element exists but is hidden by CSS
   - No = Element might not be in viewport or has other issues

3. **What logs appear when timer completes?**
   - Copy the last 10-20 lines from the debug panel

4. **Does the "Test" button make anything appear?**
   - Even if you see a red-bordered box anywhere on screen, that's useful info!

## 🚀 Quick Actions

### To Reduce Timer to 5 Seconds:
The timer is still 30 seconds by default. For faster testing, I can change it to 5 seconds if you want.

### To Add More Visible Markers:
I can make the code input box flash or add a giant arrow pointing to it when it appears.

**The debug panel is now live!** Just tap the 🐛 button and watch all the logs appear in real-time as you use the YouTube quest. This will show us exactly what's happening! 🎯
