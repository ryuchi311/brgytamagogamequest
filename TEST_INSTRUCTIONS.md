# 🐛 On-Screen Debug Panel - READY TO TEST

## ✅ What's Been Added

Since F12 doesn't work in Telegram Mini App, I've created a **complete on-screen debugging system**!

## 🎮 Features

### 1. **🐛 Debug Button**
- Yellow circular button in bottom-right corner
- Tap to show/hide the debug panel

  - 🔴 Red = Errors
  - 🟡 Yellow = Warnings
  - 🔵 Blue = Info
- Auto-scrolls to latest message

### 3. **🧪 Test Button**
- Green "Test" button in panel header
- Instantly checks if code input element exists
- Attempts to force show it with **RED BORDER**
- Shows detailed diagnostic info

### 4. **⚡ Test Mode (5-Second Timer)**
- Timer is now **5 SECONDS** instead of 30!
- Makes testing much faster
- You'll see "⚡ TEST MODE ACTIVE" in the debug log

### 5. **📝 Clear Button**
